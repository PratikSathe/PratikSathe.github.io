The benchmarking of quantum computers is crucial to understand the capabilities of existing quantum computing hardware, which in turn enables us to figure out how to improve them. One approach is to implement applications on quantum hardware and assess the performance by devising appropriate metrics, and capturing them during the implementation. Combinatorial optimization is anticipated to be one of the primary use cases for quantum computation in the coming years. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Quantum Annealing (QA) are expected to demonstrate significant run-time performance benefits over classical solutions. By using existing methods for characterizing the performance of classical optimization algorithms, we compare solution quality obtained by solving Max-Cut problems using a quantum annealing device and gate-model quantum simulators and devices. This  is used to guide the development of an advanced benchmarking framework for quantum computers designed to evaluate the trade-off between run-time execution performance and the quality of solution for iterative hybrid quantum-classical applications. Of particular relevance is how the nature of the problem input configuration impacts the solution quality, the length of time required to achieve a solution, and the algorithm limitations uncovered by the benchmarking approach. The framework is an enhancement to the existing open-source QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmark suite. The suite can be executed on various quantum simulators, quantum hardware backends, and a quantum annealing device.<br/><br/>

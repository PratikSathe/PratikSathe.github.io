A number of commerical quantum computing services are becoming available. Quantum computers are still in their infancy, and experience  a variety of errors due to imperfections in the hardware. Additionally, these features depend on the type of hardware. It is important to be quantify the strengths and weaknesses of these computers. One approach is the measure the performance of a quantum computer in terms of how successefuly it is in implementing an algorithm.

Periodically driven (Floquet) systems often exhibit behavior distinct from undriven systems. Any amount of disorder in one-dimensional undriven systems generically localizes all eigenstates. In contrast, we show that in topologically non-trivial, non-interacting Floquet loop drives with chiral symmetry, a delocalization transition occurs at as the time $$t$$ is varied within the driving period ($$0< t< T_{drive}$$). We find that the localization length L loc at all quasienergies diverges with a universal exponent of $$2$$ as $$t$$ approaches the midpoint of the drive: $$L_{loc}~(t-T_{drive}/2)-2$$. We provide numerical evidence for the universality of this exponent by studying a variety of such drives using exact diagonalization, and we also present an analytical argument based on scattering theory.

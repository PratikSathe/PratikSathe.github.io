> This post is intended to remind me how I made this website and the changes I would like to make in the future. It might be of some help to others as well.

To do's:


- Create my first blog post regarding birds. Perhaps the interaction that I saw between a hummingbird and a swinhoe's white eye.
- Check what I can do to add `www.` to my website
- Add research projects to the reserch page. Add one pic per project
- Add publications and conferences to the publications page
- Add a page with my CV (in html, and also a PDF)
- Reduce font size for:
  - Posts
  - Mast-header
- Reduce gap between list elements

<!-- ---------------
add /** Page content */
.page-content { padding: 30px 0; flex: 1; text-align: justify;} /*added text-align: justify;*/
--------------
 -->

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
 -->

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} -->

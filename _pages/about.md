I am a physics PhD candidate at UCLA, with a focus on theoretical condensed matter physics. I am passionate about using mathematics and numerical simulations in order to understand physical phenomena. I am exploring how the (spatial) localization properties of electronic wavefunctions are related to band topology, especially in contexts such as driven topological insulators and flat-band Hamiltoians. In 2020, I was awarded the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering ([CQSE](https://www.cqse.ucla.edu/)) fellowship by UCLA and recently, I am currently a UCLA Dissertation Year Fellow. 

In addition to my interest in quantum physics, I am also excited about quantum computation and information, and am optimistic about its impact on our ability to solve hard problems. With the goal of benchmarking quantum and quantum-inspired approaches to solving combinatorial approaches, I interned at [USRA-NASA's](https://www.usra.edu/) [RIACS lab](https://riacs.usra.edu/) as a [Feynman Quantum Academy](https://riacs.usra.edu/quantum/qacademy). We developed a [framework](https://github.com/bernalde/stochastic-benchmark) to systematically benchmark stochastic parametrized solvers for optimization problems. During the summer of 2022, I interned at [SRI](https://www.sri.com/) International, and contributed to the Quantum Economic Development Consortium's ([QED-C](https://quantumconsortium.org/)) application-oriented [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks). 

Outside of work, I often click photos of birds and nature. For the latest pics, do visit my Instagram [page](https://www.instagram.com/birds.are.lit/)!

<!-- I grew up in [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), India, and hold a black belt in Taekwondo. I grew up learning how to play the violin and dabbled in sketching. While studying physics at [IIT-Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay), I interned at ETH-Zurich and used numerical simulations in order to identify highly influential dynamical features in chaotic atmospheric and oceanic motion. I currently reside in Los Angeles, and love to take photos of birds! Hummingbirds are one of my favorite birds!

I am a physics PhD candidate at UCLA, with a focus on theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. I am passionate about using mathematics and numerical simulations in order to understand physical phenomena. I am exploring how the (spatial) localization properties of electronic wavefunctions are related to band topology, in materials known as topological insulators, especially in contexts such as driven topological insulators and flat band Hamiltoians. In 2020, I was awarded the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering (CQSE) fellowship by UCLA for studying how entanglement entropy grows in quantum circuits. Recently, I was awarded the Dissertation Year Fellow at UCLA, and am also a Bhaumik Graduate Fellow.

In addition to my interest in quantum physics, I am also excited about quantum computation and information, and am optimistic about its impact on our ability to solve hard problems. An important application is likely to be in solving optimization problems, many of which are hard for classical computers to solev. Hence, I am interning this summer (in 2022) at SRI International, and am working on implementing new and  enhancing several existing application-oriented benchmark programs and techniques, being developed at the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C). Specifically, I am working on benchmarking iterative hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) and VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver).

I grew up in [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), India, and hold a black belt in Taekwondo. I grew up learning how to play the violin and dabbled in sketching and drawing anime. While studying physics at [IIT-Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay), I interned at ETH-Zurich and used numerical simulations in order to identify highly influential dynamical features in chaotic atmospheric and oceanic motion. I currently reside in Los Angeles, and love to take photos of birds! Hummingbirds are one of my favorite birds!

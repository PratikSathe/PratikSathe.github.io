I am a physics PhD candidate at UCLA, working in the field of theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. I am a part of the [Roy](https://cmt-roy.physics.ucla.edu/content/rahul-roy) research group and am passionate about using mathematics and numerical simulations in order to understand physical phenomena. I am currently working towards understanding how disorder and topology affect wavefunction localization properties in quantum crystalline materials. How localized electronic wavefunctions can be, have a direct influence on physical properties of crystalline materials, such as conductivity and the ability to achieve thermal equilibrium. I am also interested in quantum computation and data science.

I grew up in [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), India, and hold a black belt in Taekwondo. I grew up learning how to play the violin and dabbled in sketching and drawing anime. While studying physics at [IIT-Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay), I interned at ETH-Zurich and used numerical simulations in order to identify highly influential dynamical features in chaotic atmospheric and oceanic motion. I currently reside in Los Angeles, and love to take photos of birds on weekends! One of my favorite types of birds is hummingbirds (hence the name _Hbirder_).

To see some of the bird photos I have taken, follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/birds.are.lit/).

I am a physics PhD student at UCLA, working in Prof. [Rahul Roy](https://cmt-roy.physics.ucla.edu/content/rahul-roy)'s group. I am working on some problems in theoretical condensed matter systems (i.e. the study of properties of crystalline materials), and my current focus is on the localization properties of (quantum) electronic wavefuntions and connections with band topology, projection operators and disorder.

I am love to observe and take photos of birds! For some of my latest pics, check out my instagram page.

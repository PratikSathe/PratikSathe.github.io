I am a physics PhD candidate at UCLA, with a focus on theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. I am passionate about using mathematics and numerical simulations in order to understand physical phenomena. I am exploring how the (spatial) localization properties of electronic wavefunctions are related to band topology, in materials known as topological insulators, especially in contexts such as driven topological insulators and flat band Hamiltoians. In 2020, I was awarded the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering ([CQSE](https://www.cqse.ucla.edu/)) fellowship by UCLA and recently, I am currently a UCLA Dissertation Year Fellow. 

In addition to my interest in quantum physics, I am also excited about quantum computation and information, and am optimistic about its impact on our ability to solve hard problems. An important application is likely to be in solving optimization problems that are hard for classical computers to solve. Hence, I am currently a [Feynman Quantum Academy](https://riacs.usra.edu/quantum/qacademy) intern at [USRA's](https://www.usra.edu/) [RIACS lab](https://riacs.usra.edu/) and am contributing to efforts to systematically benchmark the performance of stochastic solvers for optimization problems, with a particular focus on the QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm). During the summer of 2022, I interned at [SRI](https://www.sri.com/) International, and contributed to the Quantum Economic Development Consortium's ([QED-C](https://quantumconsortium.org/)) application-oriented [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks). Specifically, we developed a framework for assessing the performance of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) on various quantum computing modalities.

<!-- I grew up in [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), India, and hold a black belt in Taekwondo. I grew up learning how to play the violin and dabbled in sketching. While studying physics at [IIT-Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay), I interned at ETH-Zurich and used numerical simulations in order to identify highly influential dynamical features in chaotic atmospheric and oceanic motion. I currently reside in Los Angeles, and love to take photos of birds! Hummingbirds are one of my favorite birds!

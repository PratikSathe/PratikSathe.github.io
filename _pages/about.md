I am a physics PhD candidate at UCLA, with a focus on theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. I am passionate about using mathematics and numerical simulations in order to understand physical phenomena. I am exploring how the (spatial) localization properties of electronic wavefunctions are related to band topology, especially in contexts such as driven topological insulators and flat-band Hamiltoians. In 2020, I was awarded the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering ([CQSE](https://www.cqse.ucla.edu/)) fellowship by UCLA and recently, I am currently a UCLA Dissertation Year Fellow. 

In addition to my interest in quantum physics, I am also excited about quantum computation and information, and am optimistic about its impact on our ability to solve hard problems. An important application is likely to be in solving optimization problems that are hard for classical computers to solve. With the goal of understanding and quantifying this potential, I am currently interning at [USRA-NASA's](https://www.usra.edu/) [RIACS lab](https://riacs.usra.edu/) as a [Feynman Quantum Academy](https://riacs.usra.edu/quantum/qacademy). I am contributing to efforts to the development of a [framework](https://github.com/bernalde/stochastic-benchmark) to systematically benchmark stochastic parametrized solvers for optimization problems. The framework also provides a parameter selection strategy, grounded in a statistical analysis of a solverâ€™s response-resource profile. Much of my focus is on the the QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), which is emerging to be an advantageous quantum algorithm. During the summer of 2022, I interned at [SRI](https://www.sri.com/) International, and contributed to the Quantum Economic Development Consortium's ([QED-C](https://quantumconsortium.org/)) application-oriented [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks). Specifically, we developed a framework for assessing the performance of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) on various quantum computing modalities.

Outside of work, I often click photos of birds and nature. For the latest pics, do visit my Instagram [page](https://www.instagram.com/birds.are.lit/)!

<!-- I grew up in [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), India, and hold a black belt in Taekwondo. I grew up learning how to play the violin and dabbled in sketching. While studying physics at [IIT-Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Bombay), I interned at ETH-Zurich and used numerical simulations in order to identify highly influential dynamical features in chaotic atmospheric and oceanic motion. I currently reside in Los Angeles, and love to take photos of birds! Hummingbirds are one of my favorite birds!
